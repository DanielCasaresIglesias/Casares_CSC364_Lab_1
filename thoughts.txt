The video about vulnerabilities in our phone system was both fascinating and unsettling. It exposed how flaws in the SS7 protocol, a foundational part of global telecommunication networks, can be exploited to intercept calls and messages. I found it eye-opening, as I had not considered how easily attackers could compromise such a widely-used system. This vulnerability highlights the importance of integrating security into distributed systems from the outset rather than addressing it later. Security is often treated as an afterthought because of the pressure to deliver features and services quickly, with security sometimes viewed as an obstacle to innovation or performance. However, the risks of not embedding security are far greater, as retrofitting security measures is often inadequate and leaves systems exposed to dangerous attacks.
